### Hi There, I'm Arnav ðŸ‘‹
---- 

Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer at Predibase, where I work on scalable machine learning infrastructure and maintain/develop Ludwig (https://ludwig.ai/latest), a low-code/no-code deep learning toolbox.

Prior to Predibase, I worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at Atlassian focused on building ML-powered smart features for Confluence and Trello, notably working on the Confluence feed recommendations, Confluence Recommended Pages (Patent Pending), and suggested user invites on Trello.

I graduated from UCLA in 2020 with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. My core experience lies in deep learning (especially natural language) and backend software development. I particularly enjoy problems in social network analysis, graph networks, distributed/scalable machine learning, and large language models.
